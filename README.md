asuswrt-merlin-stable
=====================

**NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

This **was** a stable version of asuswrt-merlin, with security vulnerabilities patched via cherry-picks
from the current official version of asuswrt-merlin. This repo is based on 376.49_5 and is tested
on the RT-AC66U.  It should build and run on other models but if it breaks you get to keep all the 
pieces.

The official version of asus-wrt can be found here:
